title:  From pocket notebook to Traveler’s Notebook, my Bullet Journal journey
---

I've been using a pocket notebook ([Leuchtturm 1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/jottbook-double.html), [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/pitch-black-memo-book), [Bullet Journal Pocket](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/bullet-journal-pocket.html)) to [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com) consistently for about a year now, so I decided to level up for 2026 and upgrade to a [Traveler's Company Notebook](https://www.travelers-company.com) in their [Passport](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-passport) size. 

I started out doing some research, ended up disappearing down some YouTube rabbit holes [1](https://youtu.be/wxeq1HcIx6E?si=u5dBlM1CW-AHgmrG) [2](https://youtu.be/2q_lFLCyRNY?si=xnPLgXa5FJRv0n3P), but did eventually make a few purchases.

	1. Traveler's Company Notebook Cover (Camel)
	2. Traveler's Notebook Passport Size Writing Board 2026
	3. Traveler's Notebook Passport Size Clear Folder 2026
	4. Traveler’s Factory Passport Cotton Zipper Case (Brown)
	5. Traveler's Notebook Passport Kraft Folder
	6. Traveler's Notebook Passport Dot Grid Refill
	7. Traveler's Notebook Passport Connecting Bands
	8. [Miso Paper](https://misopaper.co.uk) Thank You card

Plan was to use the kraft folder and the cotton case alongside one notebook as my record everything, everyday carry. I have some dot grid index cards that I'm going to use for more ephemeral notes and things that need to outlive the notebooks. Paired with a Uni-Ball One P gel pen for maximum compactness.

I found the Cotton Zipper Case too bulky, making it difficult to write in the notebook in my preferred landscape orientation, so I’ve removed that and it now lives in my EDC bag as a handy organiser. With the kraft folder placed around the notebook insert, I don’t need to use the connecting bands, so they have been put away for possible future use. The writing board, along with a [Hobonichi basic stencil](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1807682139/hobonichi-stencils), are tucked in the back inside the clear folder.

Here are a few photos showing how I have my TN set up, as well as alongside a Bullet Journal Pocket Notebook for size comparison.

The other change I intend to make is to switch over to [120 Page, 68gsm Tomoe River inserts](https://goodinkpressions.com/products/copy-of-120-pages-68gsm-tomoe-river-white) from [Good Inkpressions](https://goodinkpressions.com), just so that I don’t have to swap out inserts quite so often.

Two days in and I’m loving the setup. We’ll see how I feel in a month or two 😀

And, yes, I could just as easily have sourced a nice leather cover for a Field Notes of similar sized pocket notebook, there are a tone of options on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=pocket%20notebook%20cover), but I like the additional storage options a Traveler’s Notebook gives me, as well as the flexibility to change things up should I want to.
